Fireflies
===

Intro
----

This is a simple Minetest mod by Shara RedCat that adds fireflies to the world on mapgen, which can then be caught in a net and placed in bottles to provide light. Note that they only appear on newly generated map.

This mod has been adapted from the Hidden Worlds subgame to work with minetest_game.

Thanks to shivajiva for helping work through the idea, and for assisting with the code.

Compatibility
----

Please note that the current stable version of Minetest (0.4.16) is unable to position the fireflies above groundlevel. The mod is still fully functional and can be used; but requires the current dev version of Minetest for optimal firefly placement.
