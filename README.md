Fireflies
===

Intro
----

This is a simple Minetest mod by Shara RedCat that adds fireflies to the world on mapgen, which can then be caught in a net and placed in bottles to provide light. Note that they only appear on newly generated map.

This mod has been adapted from the Hidden Worlds subgame to work with minetest_game.
